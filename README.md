# CODSOFT Task Repository

Welcome to the CODSOFT Task Repository! This repository includes projects developed as part of the CODSOFT Internship. The projects demonstrate proficiency in C++ with a strong focus on high-quality design and user experience.

## Projects

### 1.TO-DO-LIST

1. **Add Task**: Users can add new tasks with descriptions.
2. **View Tasks**: Displays all tasks with their status (Completed/Pending).
3. **Mark Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed.
4. **Remove Task**: Users can remove tasks from the list.
5. **Menu Navigation**: The main loop handles user choices and executes corresponding actions.


### 2.Simple Calculator

1. **User Input**: Prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator.
2. **Addition**: Calculates and displays the sum if the operator is `+`.
3. **Subtraction**: Calculates and displays the difference if the operator is `-`.
4. **Multiplication**: Calculates and displays the product if the operator is `*`.
5. **Division**: Checks for division by zero and calculates the quotient if the operator is `/`.

This program performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.
## 3.Tic-Tac-Toe

1. **Random Number Generation**: Initializes a random seed and generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. **User Prompt**: Informs the user about the generated random number and prompts them to guess it.
3. **User Input**: Continuously takes user guesses until the correct number is guessed.
4. **High Guess Feedback**: Informs the user if their guess is too high.
5. **Low Guess Feedback**: Informs the user if their guess is too low.
6. **Correct Guess**: Congratulates the user when they guess the correct number and ends the loop.

This program is a simple number guessing game.
